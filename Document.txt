Project Overview
This assessment focuses on evaluating participants' ability to use the if-else statement in Java for implementing conditional logic. Unlike other assessments, this project strictly avoids the use of if-else-if constructs. Participants will implement tasks to solve various problems using if-else statements.

Learning Objectives
After completing this assessment, participants will be able to:

Implement decision-making logic using the if-else statement.
Structure conditions to handle multiple scenarios using if-else.
Develop programs that solve real-world problems through conditional logic with if-else.

Assessment Tasks
Task 1: Check if a Number is Positive or Negative
Write a program to check whether a given integer is positive or negative using if-else statements.

Example:

Input: -5
Output: "The number -5 is negative."
Task 2: Find the Largest of Three Numbers
Write a program to find the largest of three given integers using if-else statements.

Example:

Input: a=10, b=20, c=15
Output: "The largest number is: 20"
Task 3: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
Write a program to check whether a given integer is even or odd using if-else statements.

Example:

Input: 8
Output: "The number 8 is even."
Task 4: Check Eligibility to Vote
Write a program to check if a person is eligible to vote using if-else statements.

Example:

Input: age=17
Output: "You are not eligible to vote."

Task 5: Grade Calculation Based on Marks
Write a program to assign grades to a student based on their marks using if-else statements:

90 and above: Grade A
75 to 89: Grade B
50 to 74: Grade C
Below 50: Grade F
Example:

Input: marks=85
Output: "Grade: B"
